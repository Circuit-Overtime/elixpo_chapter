# Connect LixRL short links

LixRL creates short, account-owned URLs without placing a personal API key in the blog editor.

## Connect

1. Open **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Choose **Connect LixRL**.
3. LixBlogs sends your Elixpo Accounts identifier, email, display name, and avatar to LixRL so it can find or provision the matching integration account.
4. The integration card displays your LixRL plan, link usage, and rate limit.

## Shorten a link in the editor

Open the link editor for a valid `http://` or `https://` destination and choose **Shorten with LixRL**. LixRL returns a short URL owned by your connected LixRL account, and the editor replaces the destination with it.

The original destination and optional link title are sent to LixRL only when you request shortening. Already-shortened LixRL links are not shortened again.

## Limits and management

Usage and rate limits come from your LixRL plan. Open the LixRL dashboard from the integration card to inspect, edit, or delete created links.

Disconnecting prevents LixBlogs from creating new short links. Existing short links remain active because they are stored and managed by LixRL.
