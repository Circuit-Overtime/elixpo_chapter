            <p>
                These terms govern your use of Elixpo Pay
                (<code>payouts.elixpo.com</code>) and the Elixpo Pay API. By
                creating a merchant account or integrating the API, you agree to
                them.
            </p>

            <h2>The service</h2>
            <p>
                Elixpo Pay is a payments and payouts platform: hosted checkout, a
                unified ledger, entitlement grants, and creator payouts. We act as
                a technical facilitator between you, your customers, and the
                underlying payment providers.
            </p>

            <h2>Merchant responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate business and payout information, and keep it current.</li>
                <li>Comply with the terms of any connected provider (Razorpay, Stripe, etc.) and applicable law.</li>
                <li>Sell only lawful products and honour the entitlements you grant customers.</li>
                <li>Keep your API keys and webhook secrets confidential. You are responsible for activity under your keys.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fees</h2>
            <p>
                Elixpo Pay may charge a platform fee (a small percentage and/or a
                flat per-transaction amount) on top of provider fees, plus payout
                fees where applicable. Fees in effect for your account are shown in
                your dashboard.
            </p>

            <h2>Payouts</h2>
            <p>
                Payouts are subject to provider settlement schedules, payout
                thresholds, and any required identity/KYC verification. We may hold
                funds where required to investigate fraud, disputes, or chargebacks.
            </p>

            <h2>Refunds & disputes</h2>
            <p>
                Refunds and chargebacks are processed through the originating
                provider. You are responsible for your own refund policy and for
                resolving disputes with your customers.
            </p>

            <h2>Availability & liability</h2>
            <p>
                The service is provided "as is" without warranties. To the maximum
                extent permitted by law, Elixpo's liability is limited to the fees
                you paid us in the preceding three months.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We may update these terms; material changes will be announced in
                the dashboard. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
            </p>
