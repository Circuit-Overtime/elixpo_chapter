/**
 * Robots policy.
 *
 * Public marketing + docs surface is crawlable. Everything that requires
 * auth (dashboard, profile, admin) is disallowed — those pages aren't
 * useful for search and shouldn't be indexed under any user's session.
 *
 * The dynamic /{code} redirect route is also disallowed so search engines
 * don't index short links as content. Short links exist to redirect, not
 * to rank.
 *
 * The API surface is disallowed: it serves JSON / CSV and isn't meant to
 * show up in SERPs.
